            <h3><center>What is computer hardware?</center></h3>
            <div id="text">
            <p>We use computers almost every day of our lives, but most people don't actually know the inner workings of one. This page is here to show the components of an average computer and what that component does.</p>

            <h3><center>Power Supply</center></h3>
            <p>A power supply unit (PSU) converts mains AC to low-voltage regulated DC power for the internal components of a computer. Modern personal computers universally use switched-mode power supplies. Some power supplies have a manual switch for selecting input voltage, while others automatically adapt to the mains voltage.</p>

            <h3><center>Optical Drive</center></h3>
            <p>In computing, an optical disc drive (ODD) is a disk drive that uses laser light or electromagnetic waves within or near the visible light spectrum as part of the process of reading or writing data to or from optical discs.</p>
            <center><img src="pictures/hardware/opdrive.jpg" alt="drive" width="300"></center>
            <h3><center>Operating System</center></h3>
            <p>An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. The operating system is a component of the system software in a computer system. Application programs usually require an operating system to function.</p>
            <center><img src="pictures/hardware/win10.jpg" alt="os" width="300"></center>
            <h3><center>Wireless Network Adapter</center></h3>
            <p>A network adapter is the component of a computer's internal hardware that is used for communicating over a network with another computer. It enable a computer to connect with another computer, server or any networking device over an LAN connection. A network adapter can be used over a wired or wireless network</p>

            <h3><center>Case Fan</center></h3>
            <p>A computer fan is any fan inside, or attached to, a computer case used for active cooling, and may refer to fans that draw cooler air into the case from the outside, expel warm air from inside, or move air across a heat sink to cool a particular component.</p>
            <center><img src="pictures/hardware/fan.jpg" alt="case-fan" width="300"></center>
            <h3><center>Monitor</center></h3>
            <p>A computer monitor is an electronic device that shows pictures. Monitors often look similar to televisions. The main difference between a monitor and a television is that a monitor does not have a television tuner to change channels. Monitors often have higher display resolution than televisions.</p>
            <center><img src="pictures/hardware/moniter.jpg" alt="moniter" width="300"></center>
            <h3><center>Keyboard</center></h3>
            <p>In computing, a computer keyboard is a typewriter-style device which uses an arrangement of buttons or keys to act as a mechanical lever or electronic switch. Following the decline of punch cards and paper tape, interaction via teleprinter-style keyboards became the main input device for computers.</p>
            <center><img src="pictures/hardware/keyboard.png" alt="keyboard" width="300"></center>
            <h3><center>Mouse</center></h3>
            <p>A computer mouse is an input device that is most often used with a personal computer. Moving a mouse along a flat surface can move the on-screen cursor to different items on the screen. Items can be moved or selected by pressing the mouse buttons (called clicking).</p>

            <h3><center>CPU</center></h3>
            <p>The CPU is the brain of the computer. The CPU controls everything that is a part of what the computer does.</p>
            <center><img src="pictures/hardware/inteli74790k.jpg" alt="cpu" width="300"></center>
            <h3><center>CPU Cooler</center></h3>
            <p>The CPU gets hot really fast and it needs a form of cooling. A CPU Cooler is to make sure that the core doesn't overheat and kill the rest of the computer. The CPU Cooler is a fan in the case of most computers but the fancier builds use a water cooling system.</p>
            <center><img src="pictures/hardware/cpu-cooler.jpg" alt="cpu-cooler" width="300"></center>
            <h3><center>Motherboard</center></h3>
            <p>The motherboard is the piece of gear that is the connecter of all of the pieces of the computer. Every part of the computer is connected to the motherboard in some way.</p>
            <center><img src="pictures/hardware/msi.jpg" alt="motherboard" width="300"></center>
            <h3><center>Memory</center></h3>
            <p>The memory of the computer is also called the RAM. RAM stands for Random Access Memory. RAM is used to hold temporary processes on the computer. The RAM is a working area of any running program.</p>
            <center><img src="pictures/hardware/ram.jpg" alt="memory" width="300"></center>
            <h3><center>SSD</center></h3>
            <p>An SSD is a Solid State Drive. An SSD is not in all computers but in PC builds, there is probably going to be one present. The SSD is considered the workspace of programs because with this extra space, programs can work faster.</p>
            <center><img src="pictures/hardware/ssd.jpg" alt="ssd" width="300"></center>
            <h3>HDD</h3>
            <p>The HDD is called a Hard Disk Drive or you could just call it a Hard Drive. Hard Drives just store data. HDD were first made in the mid '50s by IBM with the total holding size being 350 megabytes and the size of 2 refrigerators. Nowadays, there are up to 8 TERAbytes of HDDs available to the public. To put that into perspective, in about 60 years, we have gone from 350 megabytes of storage space the size of 2 fridges to 8 terabytes of storage space about the size of a smartphone. 1,000 megabytes is equal to 1 gigabyte and 1,000 gigabytes is equal to 1 terabyte. So an 8 terabyte Hard Drive is equal to 8,000,000 megabytes and all of that the size of a smartphone. Of course those large sized Hard Drives have limits. The large sized Hard Drives are usually in computers and most are external.</p>

            <h3><center>Video Card</center></h3>
            <p>The video card controls the output to a display. A display is anything that can show what the computer is trying to show you. For example, this screen you are looking at, unless on mobile, is being shown through a graphics card of some sort. Some CPUs do have integrated graphics, which mean that this card isn't necessary for small proccesses.</p>
            <center><img src="pictures/hardware/graphics.jpg" alt="video-card" width="300"></center>
            <h3><center>Case</center></h3>
            <p>To protect the insides of your computer and to have some sort of base for it to be mounted to, you need a case. In laptops, the case thinly covers the motherboard and all of the other components. In desktops, the case is bigger, holding all of the computer parts with a large amount of space of customization.</p>
