                    Vindinium is a bot game where you create your own AI to compete against others. Your objective is to gain the most gold in the allocated amount of turns (On the Vindinium Official server it is 600 turns while the provided private server we were using
                    is 1,200 turns). All of the maps you play on are random, they can have 4 mines, or they can have 20. You acquire gold through the holding of mines and each mine gives you 1 gold per turn. You can acquire gold in 3 ways; claiming free
                    mines, stealing claimed mines, or killing a person who has mines. If you die and you have mines, the person who killed you gets those mines. Always be careful of your HP, whenever you grab a mine or attacked by a player, you lose 20HP.
                    You only have 100HP and already you lose 1HP per turn by moving. To regain HP, you need to go heal at a Tavern. Tavern's cost 2 gold and will heal 50HP for you in one turn.
